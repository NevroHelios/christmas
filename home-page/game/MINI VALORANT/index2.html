      SANTA is dropping gifts while riding on the sledge. Catch the gifts before they disappear. In the first prompt, enter the time <span id="starttimeout">(starting timeout)</span> after which you want the first gift to disappear. In the second prompt, enter the time <span id="decrease">(decrease in timeout)</span> such that the second gift will disappear after the time <span id="nettime">(start timeout=start timeout-decrease in timeout)</span>  Simply click on the gift, the gift disappears and then again reappears somewhere on the screen with a different size. If you fail to click on the gift before it disappears, the game is over. You have to refresh the game and then play the game. ENJOY!! GRAB THE GIFTS BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR!
